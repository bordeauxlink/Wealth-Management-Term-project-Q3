    "1. Dependent Variable: Financial Planner’s Product Recommendation (High-risk vs Low-risk)\n",
    "    • Variable Name: Product Recommendation\n",
    "    • Description: This is a binary choice variable indicating whether the financial planner recommends a high-risk product (e.g., stocks, ETFs) or a low-risk product (e.g., mutual funds, bonds) to the client.\n",
    "        ○ Possible Values: 1 for recommending high-risk products, 0 for recommending low-risk products.\n",
    "2. Independent Variable: Financial Planner’s Personal Debt Level\n",
    "    • Variable Name: Planner Debt Level\n",
    "    • Description: This variable describes the financial planner's personal debt level. It can be either a continuous variable (e.g., total debt) or a categorical variable (e.g., high debt vs low debt).\n",
    "        ○ Possible Values: If it's categorical, 1 could represent high debt, 0 could represent low debt.\n",
    "3. Interaction Variable: Client’s Risk Tolerance\n",
    "    • Variable Name: Client Risk Profile\n",
    "    • Description: This variable describes the client’s risk tolerance, indicating whether the client prefers high-risk or low-risk investment products. It’s typically based on the client’s financial goals, investment experience, etc.\n",
    "        ○ Possible Values: 1 for clients with high-risk tolerance, 0 for clients with low-risk tolerance.\n",
    "    \n",
    "4. Control Variables (To account for other potential influencing factors in your analysis)\n",
    "    • Financial Planner Characteristics:\n",
    "        1. Age: Financial planner's age (continuous variable).\n",
    "        2. Gender: Gender (1 for male, 0 for female).\n",
    "        3. Education Level: Planner’s educational background (e.g., bachelor's, master’s, etc. – can be categorical).\n",
    "        4. Years of Experience: Number of years of work experience (continuous variable).\n",
    "        5. Compensation Structure: Whether the planner’s compensation is commission-based or fixed salary (categorical variable).\n",
    "    • Client Characteristics:\n",
    "        1. Client Age: Client’s age (continuous variable).\n",
    "        2. Client Income Level: Client’s income level (can be a categorical variable, e.g., high, medium, or low income).\n",
    "        3. Client Investment Experience: Client’s investment experience (categorical variable, e.g., novice, intermediate, advanced).\n",
    "        4. Client Investment Objective: Client’s investment goals (categorical variable, e.g., long-term growth, wealth preservation, etc.).\n",
    "    \n",
    "5. Potential Moderating or Interaction Terms\n",
    "    • Financial Planner's Personal Debt × Client's Risk Tolerance Interaction Term\n",
    "        ○ You can create an interaction variable combining the financial planner’s debt level and the client’s risk tolerance to capture how the debt affects the planner’s recommendation for different types of clients.\n",
    "        ○ Variable Formula: Planner Debt × Client Risk Profile\n",
    "1.For question 3, our group chose this question, how does a financial planner's personal debt level affect their ability to recommend high-risk versus low-risk investment products for clients with different risk profiles?Is this research topic feasible?\n",
    "\n",
    "2.In terms of data selection, is the Debt-to-Income Ratio (DIR) more reasonable or the Credit Score (CS) more reasonable?\n",
    "3.For the binary choice of recommendation behavior, we plan to use Logit or Probit models, but are there other models (e.g., multilevel or fixed-effects models) that can better capture the effect of debt level on recommendations for different clients?\n"
